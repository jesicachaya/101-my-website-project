                <h2> A little bit about me. </h2>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I am a first generation Lebanese American and was born and raised in New England. My journey into
                        tech is quite the
                        zig-zag of a path! I had my first taste in a coding class in college as I was double majoring in
                        math and education.
                        I really enjoyed the challenge of problem-solving and creating something meaningful from scratch
                        and that stuck with me!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>That sparked something behind a door that could never be shut. But first I dipped my toes into a
                        few different careers - high school math teacher, personal trainer, health coach for a startup
                        app, amongst other things. Weird path? Maybe. But wouldn't change it for anything because my
                        past experiences allow me to enter tech with so much valuable fieldwork under my belt that allow
                        me a unique perspective on the variety of projects I get to work on! When I learned how to build
                        my first website, I realized
                        I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've
                        made a full switch
                        to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write
                        clean, elegant code. Just as I've chased my passion, I'd love to help you chase yours!

                    <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content
                        is easy to read, easy
                        to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                    <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean
                        and fast to load, and
                        I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                    <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                    <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that
                        is pixel-perfect
                        match.</p>
